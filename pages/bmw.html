        BMW, in full Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, German automaker noted for
        quality sports sedans and motorcycles. Headquarters are in Munich. It
        originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, a builder of aircraft
        engines, but assumed the name Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and
        began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered the automobile
        business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record
        that was not broken until 1937. During World War II BMW built the
        world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the Luftwaffe, Germany’s air
        force. After the war the company tried to move into the small-car market
        but found that it could not compete effectively against Volkswagen’s
        compact, inexpensive autos. By 1959 the company was on the verge of
        bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to
        Daimler-Benz.
