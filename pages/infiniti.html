        The beginning 1989â€“1993 Infiniti Q45 The Infiniti brand was introduced
        in the United States in 1989 to target the premium vehicle segments in
        the United States that would not have otherwise fit in with Nissan's
        more mainstream image, and partially influenced by the Plaza Accord of
        1985. The brand was created around the same time as Japanese rivals
        Toyota and Honda developed their Lexus and Acura premium brands. The
        Japanese government imposed voluntary export restraints for the U.S.
        market, so it was more profitable for automakers to export more
        expensive cars to the U.S.
