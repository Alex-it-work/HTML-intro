        Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first
        internal combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen
        – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] –
        and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of
        a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later
        that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by
        Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG). Emil Jellinek, a European automobile
        entrepreneur who worked with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG),
        registered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after
        his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing
        strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the
        highest circles of society in his adopted home. At the time, it was a
        meeting place for the "Haute Volée" of France and Europe, especially in
        winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other
        well-known people. But Jellinek's plans went further, and in as early as
        1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, including
        United States billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At
        the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym
        "Monsieur Mercédès" as a way of concealing his less fancy real name.
        Many consider that race the time of birth for Mercedes-Benz as a brand.
        Later, in 1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide
        as a protected trademark.[12] The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles
        were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb
        Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same
        year.
